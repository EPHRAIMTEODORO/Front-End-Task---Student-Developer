# Front-End Task - Student Developer

## Scenario

You've just joined a development team as a junior front-end developer. Your first task is to fix some bugs in a simple web application that handles request submissions. The previous developer left the code in a partially working state, and it's up to you to identify and resolve the issues.

The application has two main features:
1. **Submit Button**: When clicked, it should display a success message to the user
2. **Show Requests Button**: When clicked, it should toggle the visibility of a list of requests

## Your Task

Open the `index.html` file and debug the code. The application currently has bugs that prevent it from working correctly.

### Expected Behavior

1. When the user clicks the **Submit** button:
   - A green success message saying "Request submitted successfully." should appear below the button

2. When the user clicks the **Show Requests** button:
   - The list of requests (Request A, B, C) should become visible
   - Clicking it again should hide the list (toggle functionality)
